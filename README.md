# Neural-Network-for-Enhancing-PyBAMM-Simulated-VIT-Profiles
Created after my 2025 McMaster Automotive Resource Centre internship, this encapsulates all my knowledge of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Explanations and arrangements were done by me, code was written by John Guirguis, a PhD candidate in my lab. 
NOTES:
- This is a project purely to show demonstration, display what I learned about machine learning.
- As a result, the corresponding .pkl files are not uploaded. Please install those you would like to use and change the variable names in the program accordingly.
- Also ensure the directories are proper for your computer if you plan to test the code yourself.
- Ensure Jupyter/Anaconda is installed in the appropriate spot, and ensure the Python version running inside of your kernel is 3.10 as PyBAMM (simulation library) is not compatible with the recent versions of Python.
